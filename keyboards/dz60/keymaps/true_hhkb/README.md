# Modified "True" HHKB Layout

The physical layout matches 100% a real HHKB board (with the 6u spacebar).

Layout can be viewed [here](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/fd878f0072af5bba30b46305f1fac2e2).

The keymap is very similar to an HHKB in Mac mode, with some modifications to the Fn layer:
- Removed Scroll Lock and Pause
- Moved Print Screen
- Moved Delete
- Swapped Volume Up and Down (more intuitive for left to right language users)
- Added Rewind, Fast Forward, Play/Pause

There is also a third layer (activated with Fn + Right Meta) for RGB light control.
